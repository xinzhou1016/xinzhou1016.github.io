                <p>
                    My research studies the creator economy and digital platforms, 
                    with a particular focus on how content creators monetize their work 
                    and how platform design and AI shape creator behavior.

                        <h3>Democratizing the Creator Economy: Monetizing Through Subscriptions</h3>
                        <p><em>with Kai Zhu</em></p>
                        <p>
                            Platforms increasingly provide direct monetization opportunities through 
                            creator–viewer subscriptions, contrasting with traditional reach-driven 
                            advertising models. We study the impact of the Twitch Affiliate Program (TAP), 
                            which substantially lowered entry barriers to paid channel subscriptions and 
                            micro-donations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using a time-shifted difference-in-differences design, we estimate causal effects 
                            on creator production, strategy, and revenue. TAP significantly increases content 
                            supply, especially among smaller creators, whose streaming hours more than double. 
                            Effort dynamics exhibit goal-gradient patterns, peaking prior to qualification and 
                            stabilizing at a higher level afterward. Monetization access also professionalizes 
                            creator behavior, leading to more deliberate content strategies and improved game 
                            performance. Revenue estimates show that TAP provides meaningful supplementary 
                            income even for median creators, demonstrating that low-barrier subscription models 
                            can broaden participation and complement advertising-based monetization.

                        <h3>Network Effects and Platform Competition: Insights from Online Dating Markets</h3>
                        <p><em>with Kai Zhu and Qiaoni Shi</em></p>
                        <p>
                            This project studies how network effects shape competition in matching platforms. 
                            Using a rich dataset on dating apps across Chinese cities from 2018–2024, we ask:
                            (1) To what extent do network effects influence user engagement? 
                            (2) How do local market characteristics shape these effects? 
                            (3) How does heterogeneity in network effects affect platform competition? 
                            (4) How do different network strengths and policy interventions shape market equilibria?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our structural framework leverages variation in local market shares across cities 
                            for identification. The findings aim to inform platform strategy, competition policy, 
                            and antitrust analysis by highlighting the importance of localized and heterogeneous 
                            network effects in platform markets.
